# Calcium

## About
Calcium is a high-level, dynamic, weakly-typed interpreted language written in C++ by [Dm123321_31mD Gaming](https://github.com/dm12332131md). Its syntax was inspired by [x86 Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language), [Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file), and [x2 (Original)](https://github.com/ii-Python/x2).

It includes features such as:
- Built-in Libraries
- Garbage Collection
- Object Oriented Syntax
- Package Systems
- ...and more!
